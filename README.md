# Introduction
Knowledge discovery and management was a course, which I took at UMKC in Spring 2020. Knowledge discovery, sometimes called knowledge extraction is the creation of knowledge from structured sources like databases and unstructured sources like social media. In this course, I was using knowledge discovery and management in big data. The following topics were covered.

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP).

2. Information Retrieval/Information Extraction.

3. Topic Discovery. 

4. Knowledge Graph Construction.

5. Knowledge Graph Refinement with Machine Learning.

- Artificial Neural Networks.

- Recurrent Neural Network.

This course had in class programming called ICP.
